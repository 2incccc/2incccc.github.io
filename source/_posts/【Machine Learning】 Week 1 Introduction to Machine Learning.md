# Week 1    Introduction to Machine Learning

> Welcome to the Machine Learning Specialization! You're joining millions of others who have taken either this or the original course, which led to the founding of Coursera, and has helped millions of other learners, like you, take a look at the exciting world of machine learning!


## Overview of Machine Learning

In this class, one of the relatively unique things you learn is you learn a lot about the best practices for how to actually develop a practical, valuable machine learning system.


## Supervised vs. Unsupervised Machine Learning

### Supervised learning （有监督学习）
**Characteristics**: Learn from being told the right answers, and find the correct answer
**Application**: spam filtering; speech recognition; machine translation; online advertising; silf-driving car; visual inspection

Including:
**Regression（回归）**: predict a number from infinitely many possible numbers
**Classification（分类）**: predict categories, which don't have to be numbers

### Unsupervised learning （无监督学习）
**Characteristics**: Not being told the right answer, and find something intersting(patterns of structures) in unlabeled data, or to say, place the unlabeled data, into different clusters 

**Formal definition**: in unsupervised learning, the data comes only with inputs x but not output labels y, and the algorithm has to find some structure or some pattern or something interesting in the data.

Including:
**Clustering**（集群）: Group similar data points together
**Dimensionality reduction**（降维）: Compress data using fewer numbers
**Anomaly detection**（异常检测）: Find unusual data points

### Jupyter Notebooks
The most widely used tool by machine learning and data science practitioners

Optional labs: open and run one line at a time with usually no need to write any code yourself
Practice labs: give you an opportunity to write some of that code yourself
